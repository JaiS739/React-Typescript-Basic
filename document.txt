Q. Why typescript + react ?
Ans. with static type checking you get to learn about potentials bugs as you are typing the code, than heading to the browser and figuring out at runtime.

It provides way to describe the shape of an object hence providing better documentation and autocomplete.

Makes maintencenace and refactoring of large code bases much easier.


Q. How to start the app with typescript and react?
Ans. npx-create-react-app <app-name> --template typescript


---------------------------------
In Status.tsx file you can see that there are three messages "success" "error" "loading" but if in case if the prop value is not any of these like "asdasd" then if we give type string then it is not going to give any errors so to overcome this we can use type as "loading" | "success" | "error". So these will be checked only not other characters or string like "asdasd".




==> Optional Props = If you dont want to pass any value to the      component then you can use ? mark at the end of the key like :-
    In app.tsx file line no 26 we are using Greeet component but not passing the count value so it will throw error to overcome this problem we can add a ? at the end of the key when defining the type in the Greet component.



==> How to type event in typescript?


==> Destructuring the props just like we do with props in react.

==> Creating a seperate file for Types and importing it to the component where it is needed.

==> type assertion
    if we are sure that the value will not be null as soon as the component mount then we can use type assertion but if we not sure that the value in future will be there or null then we should use <AuthUser | null> check the User.txs component.
    
==> LEARNING
    use of ? (ternary operator) to check if the object exits or not.

    How to amend (to add something in the same commit if it is not went to the repo)
    -> if you have added a commit and did not push the code to the repo
        and you want to change something without any extra commit then
        use -> git commit --amend
    to check the difference use -> git diff --cached
